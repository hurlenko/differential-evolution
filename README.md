# Differential Evolution

Simple implementation of Differential Evolution algorithm written in python3. Differential evolution (DE) is a method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality.

## Usage

- Install Numpy

```bash
pip install numpy
```

- Tweak constants in `de.py`, fitness function, number of iterations etc.
- Run

```python
python es.py
```
